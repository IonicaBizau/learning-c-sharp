# Priority Queue

 - insert
 - remove maximum

## API

 - `MaxPQ(int initCapacity)`
 - `MaxPQ(...)`
 - `Key max()` - max key from queue
 - `Key delMax()` - remove the max key
 - `void insert(Key x)` - add a nwe key
 - `bool isEmpty()`
 - `int size()`

## Binary Heap

 - an efficient way to do the priority queue operations
 - each key is greater than other two keys from a provided position
 - it's a binary tree where the key from a node is greater or equal with the child keys
