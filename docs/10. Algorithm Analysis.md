# Algorithm Analysis

 - questions
   - For how much time will the program run?
   - How much memory will be used?
 - answer factors
   - machine properties
   - processed data
   - algorithm implementation
     - see what's going on
     - speculate about an implementation
     - think what will be going on
     - verify if your speculations are true
     - validate the solution by repeating the above steps
